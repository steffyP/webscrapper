## What is this? ##
This is a simple use case of using scrappy in order to extract data from the web.

## What is it used for? ##
I used it to automatically download files for courses of the pentester academy.
*NOTE:* You will need to have an active subscription in order to download files.

My intention was to download files so I can access them offline, eg. when travelling to be independent from internet connection.

## Why ##
This is just a showcase demo of how to use scrappy.
